# Data Project

## The Superstore Product Sales Analysis Project

This project delves into the sales performance of a fictional superstore, offering actionable insights for improved decision-making. Using SQL, Tableau and Power BI, I analyzed key sales metrics, uncovered trends, and addressed pressing sales challenges.

Key Trends and Metrics:

Sales Distribution
Identified product categories and regions contributing the most and least to total sales.
Profitability Analysis: Revealed high-performing products and segments, as well as those incurring losses.
Customer Trends: Highlighted purchasing behaviours and seasonal sales patterns that drive revenue.

Sales Problems Addressed:
Low Sales in Specific Regions: Pinpointed underperforming regions and recommended strategies such as targeted marketing campaigns and inventory adjustments.
High Return Rates: Analyzed discounting strategies and their impact, guiding to optimize pricing policies and reduce unnecessary returns.
Stockouts in High-Demand Categories: Identified inventory gaps and implemented forecasting models to maintain optimal stock levels.
